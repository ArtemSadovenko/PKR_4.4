I am

having trouble getting my program to read the spaces in my input file, I am new to and objects in general so any help would be appreciated.

My input file is: Hello my name is Pierre. I like to code .
My output file is: HellomynameisPierre.Iliketocode.

Another question I have is how can I check if my string has more than one space, and if it does, replace it with only one space.
